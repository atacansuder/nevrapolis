# nevrapolis (Message log bot)

This is the first "coding job" that I got. I coded this for a discord server that I used to spend some time in. Seeing my "gambling bot", the admins reached out to me and asked if I can program a bot that can log the deleted and edited messages in the server, since the server was suffering from some trolls.
